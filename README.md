# ADT-Classes

# OverView
This C++ library provides implementations of various Abstract Data Types (ADTs) commonly used in data structures and algorithms. These implementations are designed for both educational purposes and practical applications, offering efficient, flexible, and easy-to-use interfaces.

# Included ADTs
## 1. Vector
A dynamic array that provides random access, dynamic resizing, and iterator support.

**Features:** Dynamic resizing, random access, exception safety, custom memory management.

## 2. Stack
A Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure for managing elements in a stack.

**Features:** Push, pop, top operations, size, and empty checks.

## 3. Queue
A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure for managing elements in a queue.

**Features:** Enqueue, dequeue, front, and back operations, size, and empty checks.

## 4. LinkedList
A singly linked list that provides efficient insertions and deletions.

**Features:** Insert, remove, and search operations, iterator support.  

## 5. DoublyLinkedList
A doubly linked list that allows traversal in both directions.

**Features:** Insert, remove, and search operations, iterator support.

## 6. BinaryTree
A binary tree structure supporting insertion, search, and traversal operations.

**Features:** Insert, search, in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals.
